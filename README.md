# Eye Diseases Classification 🧠👁️

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to classify eye diseases from retinal images using **Deep Learning** techniques.
The model helps in early detection of eye diseases by analyzing medical images.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Transfer Learning
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV

## 📊 Dataset
- Retinal eye images
- Multiple classes representing different eye diseases
- Dataset is preprocessed (resizing, normalization, augmentation)

## 🧠 Model
- CNN architecture
- Transfer Learning using a pre-trained model EfficientNetB3
- Optimized using Adam optimizer
- Evaluated using accuracy and loss metrics
